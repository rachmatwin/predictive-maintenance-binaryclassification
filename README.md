Company X is a company that has been producing spare parts for motor vehicles since 2000 with consumers consisting of several automotive manufacturers in Indonesia. The spare parts produced include bearings, crank shafts, pistons, and others.

With quality products and international standards, Company X wants to expand its business to international markets. However, there was a problem with machine failure during the production process which resulted in additional operational costs. The existence of these additional costs causes Company X to not be feasible to expand its business overseas.

After further identification, the causes of engine damage consist of 5 types, namely tool wear failures, heat dissipation failures, power failures, overstrain failures, and random failures.

In an effort to minimize the occurrence of machine damage, the production director asked us to create a model that can predict the occurrence of machine damage based on the features that have been collected. The expected output from the modeling we make is a model capable of predicting whether a machine is damaged or not (binary classification). In addition, we were asked to provide recommendations for machine maintenance actions after obtaining the best model so that production operational costs can be optimally reduced.
